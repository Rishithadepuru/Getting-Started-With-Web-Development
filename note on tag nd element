4. Short Note on Tag and Element 
● Tag: A tag is a keyword enclosed in angle brackets (<>). It defines how content should be displayed in HTML. 
● Element: An element consists of a start tag, content, and an end tag. Example: 
<p>This is a paragraph.</p> 
Here: 
● <p> is the start tag. 
● "This is a paragraph." is the content. 
● </p> is the end tag. 
● Together, they form a paragraph element.
